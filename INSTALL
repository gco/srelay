The srelay Installation Tips.
    $Id: INSTALL,v 1.4 2009/09/04 08:29:40 bulkstream Exp $

o How to build and install

    Unpack the source.

	% gzip -dc srelay-X.Y.Z.tar.gz | tar xvf -
	% cd srelay-X.Y.Z

    Run configure.
      To see configuration options,
	% ./configure --help

      Configuration options.
	 --disable-thread               disable pthread feature.
	srelay configures to use pthread by default. if you prefer not
	to use pthread (to use forking server), disable it.

	 --with-libbind[=PATH]          to use libbind.
	If your system does not have IPv6 compatible name resolving API;
	getaddrinfo, getnameinfo,...etc.(e.g. Solaris 2.6), you have to
	prepare libbind library prior to configure srelay.
	Please See LIBBIND INSTALL.

	 --with-libwrap[=PATH|yes|no]   with tcp_wrapper access control.
	If your system has libwrap, you can use the same access control
	base.

	 --with-syslog-fac=FACILITY     syslog facility (LOG_DAEMON).
	Srelay logs through syslog. the default facility is LOG_DAEMON.

    Make
	If configure works without any errors, run make.

	% make

	( currently I have no 'install' target in Makefile. )

o MacOSX
    MacOSX(10.4 or newer) users can setup daemon using Apple's new
    launchd mechanism.
    After building the srelay binary, put it in appropriate directry.
    e.g.)
	$cp srelay /usr/local/sbin/.

    then, prepare the file called 'launchd plist'. Example is in 
    scripts directry, 'local.srelay.plist'.
    put this file into 
    	/Library/LaunchDaemons/.

    you should not put it into /System/Library/LaunchDaemons.
    Try these command and see ps or syslog output. launchd errors are
    reported in /var/log/system.log. srelay's errors are syslog
    daemon.* facility by default. please check your syslog.conf setting.

    	$ cd /Library/LaunchDaemons
	$ launchctl load -F local.srelay.plist

	    Sample plist file disables start up by default.
	    '-F' option ignores this property and 'force' start up
	    the daemon.
	    If some running test being well, and if you would
	    like the daemon starts at the system start up,
	    reload the plist like,

	$ launchctl unload local.srelay.plist
    	$ launchctl load -w local.srelay.plist


o Solaris 10
    Solaris 10 has SMF to control system start up daemons. you can
    setup srelay as service (daemon) under control of this facility.

    copy a file from scripts directory to appropriate place.
    	 # cp scripts/svc-srelay /lib/svc/method/.

    svc-srelay is just a start up shell and called from SMF.
    type svccfg command to register the service.
    	 # svccfg import scripts/srelay.xml

    srelay.xml is a sample SMF service manifest description (may be).

    if no error, srelay process should be seen in ps result.
    Log outputs are syslog daemon.* facility.

    daemon stop/start operations.
    	 start srelay
    	 # svcadm enable network/srelay
	 stop srelay
	 # svcadm disable network/srelay

    unregister from SMF
    	 # svcadm disable network/srelay
	 # svccfg delete network/srelay

o FreeBSD
    scripts/srelay.sh is a sample startup script for FreeBSD.
    don't forget setting srelay_enable="Yes" to rc.conf. Or you
    can avoid this check comment out or removing
    	rcvar=`set_rcvar`
    line.

o Linux
    scripts/rc.srelay is a sample for Linux. you can register
    srelay as 'srelay' service,
    	 # cp rc.srelay /etc/init.d/srelay
	 # cd /etc/init.d
	 # chkconfig --add srelay
    starting service,
         # /sbin/service srelay start
    stopping service,
         # /sbin/service srelay stop

    unregister it,
    	 # chkconfig --del srelay


o LIBBIND INSTALL
    (currently not tested. you may not need unless using ancient OSs
    nor try running on arduino ;-)

    To install libbind, you have to get source code from outside this
    package. ISC libbind may be handy for it.
    Or, You could have installed BIND with its libraries, please check
    the installation pathes of BIND before these steps.

    To get ISC libbind source, see
       	https://www.isc.org/software/libbind
	and fetch/wget, etc.
	ftp://ftp.isc.org/isc/libbind/6.0/libbind-6.0.tar.gz

    And, build.
	% gzip -dc libbind-6.0.tar.gz | tar xvf -
	% cd libbind-6.0
	% ./configure
	% make
	% make DESTDIR=/path/to/temp install

    check the includes and libbind.a are there in
	/path/to/temp/usr/local/bind/inclue
	/path/to/temp/usr/local/lib

    Then, you can configure the srelay.
	% cd /path/of/srelay-X.Y.Z
	% env LIBS="-L/path/to/temp/usr/local/lib" \
	  ./configure --with-libbind=/path/to/temp/usr/local/bind
	% make
