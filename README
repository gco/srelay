	You can talk to SOCKS server of at most 3-hop away from your PC, etc.
	i.e.

	Client-PC --> Srelay --> socks1 --> socsk2 --> TARGET

	socks1 and socks2 are typical SOCKS servers, serving freely or
	in some particular purposes..
	How to set up this is a little bit complecated, but you can.

	OTOH, Srelay as normal SOCKS server is extremely simple.
	If you have binary, just start as
	$ ./srelay
	on your server host, then, use from your SOCKS clients (Browsers, Tor, ..
	setting like,
	   SOCKS_PROXY=serverhost:1080
	or any other appropriate way of setting.
	If you met some trouble, check out your FireWall setting, Virus Protections,
	and so on.

	Enjoy!!
